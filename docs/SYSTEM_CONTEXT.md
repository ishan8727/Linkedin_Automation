You are implementing a backend for a LinkedIn Automation SaaS.

These files are the source of truth:
- ProductRequirementsDocument.md
- HighLevelDesign_HLD.md
- FunctionalSpecification.md
- APIContractsLinkedIn.md
- schema.sql

Rules:
- You MUST NOT invent new tables, columns, or relationships.
- You MUST NOT invent new APIs.
- You MUST follow schema.sql exactly.
- If something is missing, ask before implementing.

This is an implementation task, not a design task.
